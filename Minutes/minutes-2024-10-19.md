# Agenda Items:
1. Review of blocker issues and bounty process
1. Discussion on file structure changes
1. Update on Boolean fixes
1. Introduction of "safe mode" feature
1. Discussion on addressing regressions
1. Potential UI tweaks for 1.0 release

# Discussion Points:

## Blocker Issues and Bounty Process:

* The group reviewed the list of 11 open blocker issues.
* They decided to remove the blocker tag from some issues that were not critical blockers.
* For the remaining blocker issues, the group agreed to assign $500 bounties to incentivize the community to help resolve them.
* The process for claiming bounties was discussed, with the recommendation to comment or assign oneself to the issue to avoid overlapping efforts.


## File Structure Changes:

* The group discussed the proposal to reuse the FreeCAD FCStd file format with some modifications.
* The idea is to add parameters in the document.xml file to define the file type (part, drawing, assembly) and allow users to add custom attributes.
* This would provide better file type recognition and allow users to customize file metadata.
* The group agreed this was a good approach and suggested reaching out to the BIM community for feedback.


## Boolean Fixes:

* Corvus Corvax provided an update on the PR that addresses several Boolean-related issues.
* The changes involve a wrapper around the OpenCASCADE Boolean operations to improve tolerance handling.
* The group discussed the complexity of the changes and the need for thorough testing before merging into the 1.0 release.
* The plan is to merge the PR into the main branch and monitor for any regressions during the next release candidate.


## Safe Mode:

* Ariana introduced the "safe mode" feature, which allows users to run FreeCAD with a clean slate by remapping configuration and add-on directories.
* This feature can be helpful for troubleshooting issues and identifying if a problem is caused by user configurations or add-ons.
* The group agreed that this would be a valuable addition to the 1.0 release and planned to merge the PR during the next review meeting.


## Regressions:

* New Joker suggested reviewing the list of regression issues and prioritizing the most critical ones for the 1.0.1 release.
* The group discussed the approach of identifying common issues, such as sketcher problems or solver convergence failures, and addressing them.
* It was also suggested to provide documentation on how users can perform a git bisect to help identify when regressions were introduced.


## UI Tweaks:

* New Joker proposed considering some minor UI tweaks for the 1.0 release, such as making sketcher geometry and dimensions more visible by default.
* The group acknowledged the need to balance usability improvements with the risk of introducing regressions or conflicts with ongoing UI work.
* It was recommended to submit individual issues for each proposed change and have the Design Working Group review and approve them before implementation.


# Decisions Made:
* Removed the blocker tag from non-critical issues and assigned $500 bounties to the remaining blocker issues.
* Approved the proposed file structure changes and suggested reaching out to the BIM community for feedback.
* Planned to merge the Boolean fixes PR into the main branch and monitor for regressions during the next release candidate.
* Decided to merge the "safe mode" feature into the 1.0 release.
* Agreed to review the regression issues list and prioritize the most critical ones for the 1.0.1 release.
* Recommended submitting individual issues for any proposed UI tweaks and having the Design Working Group review and approve them.
