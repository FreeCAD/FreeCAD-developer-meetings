[00:00:02] A meeting commenced with 12 participants present. The screen was set up for recording, and the setup was confirmed to be functioning properly after a test was conducted the previous day. 

[00:00:55] The first agenda item was to discuss transitioning to Qt6 only. Chris Hans, who was not present, had raised concerns about the end of support for Ubuntu 20 LTS in April 2022 and the significant developer effort required to maintain support for Qt5. The discussion focused on when and how to make the switch to Qt6.

[00:01:38] One participant suggested raising the minimum version supported, while another expressed hesitance about dropping Qt5 support entirely, noting that some users might still rely on Ubuntu 22, which does not support Qt5 by default. The conversation highlighted the need to consider the implications for users on different distributions.

[00:02:47] The group acknowledged that maintaining support for Qt5 would be necessary for a while longer, especially for users who compile Frigad themselves. The discussion also touched on the challenges faced by users on Linux systems, where the latest versions of libraries may not be available.

[00:03:59] Alex Sander raised concerns about the impact on operations, particularly regarding older versions of Windows and macOS. The minimum version for macOS was noted to be 10.13, but the minimum Qt5 version was unclear. The group agreed that the issue primarily affected Linux users, as they often rely on system-provided libraries.

[00:05:00] A participant argued for dropping Qt5 support, citing that Qt5 would no longer be supported after May 2025. They noted that Ubuntu 20.04 is already several versions behind and suggested that it may not be worth targeting it for future updates. The conversation continued with a focus on the implications for LTS versions of Ubuntu.

[00:06:55] The group discussed the lack of support for Qt5 in newer Ubuntu versions and the potential for using AppImage, Snap, or Flatpak to mitigate issues for users. The consensus was that developers could add PPAs to install the necessary versions of Qt.

[00:09:01] Crescent's agenda item regarding the headaches caused by supporting Qt5 was debated. Some participants felt that the issues were manageable, while others pointed out specific problems that arose when trying to maintain compatibility between Qt5 and Qt6.

[00:10:24] A participant shared their experience with difficulties in supporting both versions, particularly with UI components. They emphasized that maintaining both versions would require significant ongoing effort and suggested that the team should plan for the retirement of Qt5 after the release of version 1.0.

[00:12:54] The discussion shifted to the need for a clear policy regarding Qt5 support. It was proposed that while the code for Qt5 could remain, the team should not prioritize fixing issues related to it. The focus should be on advancing development with Qt6.

[00:17:01] The meeting moved on to the next agenda item regarding recent changes with tolerances. Stump expressed concerns about changes made to the tolerance kernel, stating that the adjustments were invalid and had led to significant issues with model functionality.

[00:19:20] Stump highlighted that the increased tolerance levels were problematic, especially for precision tasks like injection molding. They emphasized the need for appropriate tolerances for post-processing and expressed frustration over the lack of communication regarding these changes.

[00:22:13] The group acknowledged the issue as a bug that needed to be reported and addressed. They discussed the importance of following the proper process for bug reporting to ensure that developers could investigate and resolve the problem effectively.
[00:23:46] The discussion revolves around the process of reporting bugs, identifying their causes, and fixing them. It is emphasized that opening a bug report is essential for developers to see the issues and address them. 

[00:24:05] A participant questions why the bug was not checked before, but the response indicates uncertainty about the previous checks. It is noted that the main branch is not expected to be stable, and experimental work is anticipated there, which can lead to bugs.

[00:24:41] Another participant suggests moving to step six of the discussion to address the issue of filing a bug report, especially since one member expressed reluctance to use a GitHub account. The conversation shifts towards how to facilitate bug reporting.

[00:25:40] A participant reiterates that the main branch's instability is expected and that finding and reporting bugs is part of the development process. They acknowledge the importance of fixing issues but suggest that the fuss over bugs should be moderated since they are part of the expected workflow.

[00:26:32] The need for proper testing before merging code is highlighted, with a participant stressing that eye tests are insufficient. They advocate for thorough testing to ensure quality before merging changes.

[00:27:06] A participant mentions that merging too quickly without adequate testing is a concern and suggests that this could be a lengthy discussion, preferring to address it later to avoid derailing the current meeting.

[00:27:49] David shares his experience, stating that no amount of testing by a single developer can uncover all potential issues. He emphasizes the importance of community testing and reporting to identify side effects that may not be caught during individual testing.

[00:28:56] The conversation touches on the challenges of testing and the limitations of individual developers in identifying all issues. David points out that the current development cycle is experimental, which can lead to significant impacts.

[00:29:50] A participant expresses frustration about the size of files being tested and the difficulty in reproducing issues. They mention that they have created small working samples to demonstrate problems but feel their reports are being ignored.

[00:30:46] There is a consensus that the issue being discussed should not be overlooked, and participants agree to transfer the discussion to GitHub for better tracking and resolution.

[00:31:14] Provost mentions a previous forum thread where the issue was raised and requests test examples to reproduce the problem. They stress the importance of providing specific files to help identify the issues.

[00:32:22] A suggestion is made to share the forum link in the chat for everyone to review and contribute to the discussion on bug reporting. The group agrees to tackle the bug systematically.

[00:33:12] The meeting transitions to the next topic, which involves prioritizing issues related to granting recursion. The speaker explains that this combines bond and grant formats to address relevant issues more efficiently.

[00:34:08] The proposal aims to create a fast-tracked bounty program that allows for quicker resolution of issues by relevant experts. The discussion highlights the need for a structured approach to managing grants and bounties.

[00:35:17] Cadet supports the idea of a grant proposal process, noting that while bounties are beneficial, they require prior decisions on which issues to address. They suggest a middle ground for applying for grants for known issues.

[00:36:58] The conversation emphasizes the importance of having a controlled environment for bounties, where developers can pick issues and the budget is managed effectively. This structure aims to prevent frustrations associated with traditional bounty systems.

[00:38:10] The group discusses the potential for bounties to be placed not only on difficult issues but also on mundane tasks that developers may avoid. The idea is that financial incentives can motivate developers to tackle less appealing tasks.

[00:40:01] The meeting concludes with a focus on ensuring that bounties are allocated thoughtfully, considering both challenging and tedious issues, to maximize developer engagement and productivity.
[00:40:52] Developers often find certain issues, particularly those that are boring, less appealing to work on. When financial incentives, such as bounties, are introduced, developers are more likely to engage with these issues. It is suggested that bounties should not only be placed on complex problems but also on simpler, mundane tasks that developers might overlook due to lack of interest. Even a small bounty, like $50 for a straightforward fix, can motivate developers to tackle these less exciting issues, providing them with some compensation for their time.

[00:41:46] There is a discussion about the criteria for placing bounties on issues. It is noted that in previous meetings, bounties were placed on all blocker issues for a major release. For future bounty programs, a more structured approach is needed, involving a group of experienced maintainers who can label issues as candidates for bounties. Engaging the community in this process is also emphasized, suggesting that developers could indicate which issues they find important, thus creating a two-step process where community input is considered before final decisions are made by a technical team.

[00:44:01] The importance of ensuring that the issues selected for bounties make technical sense is highlighted. There is a concern that some issues may not be technically feasible or relevant, and the decision-making process should prioritize technical validity over popularity. The idea is to create a system where community members can express interest in certain issues, which can then be filtered by a technical team to determine their suitability for bounties.

[00:46:19] David raises additional considerations regarding the selection of issues for bounties. He suggests that it is crucial to identify issues that are being ignored or overlooked, as well as to ensure that the solutions proposed are of high quality. There is a consensus that while it is important to prioritize issues that no one is currently working on, it should also be possible for volunteers to request compensation for their contributions.

[00:48:00] The conversation shifts to the potential for grants to support upstream projects that benefit the community. There is a proposal to allow grants for work on projects that are essential to the ecosystem, such as those related to Coin. This idea is seen as a way to support projects that the community relies on, and it is suggested that this topic should be discussed further in future meetings.

[00:50:14] The next topic of discussion is the storage of Continuous Integration (CI) artifacts for testing purposes. Developers have expressed a need to download CI artifacts to test their work in various environments, particularly on Windows, which poses challenges for setting up development environments. Currently, there is no archiving of these artifacts, and doing so would require additional storage resources, which are limited.

[00:52:01] It is proposed that a solution could involve manually requesting the storage of artifacts when needed, rather than storing everything by default. This would help manage storage costs while still providing access to necessary artifacts. The discussion also touches on the possibility of using existing storage for caching artifacts, which has a limited capacity.

[00:53:10] The conversation continues with suggestions for developers to run CI workflows locally using tools like "act," which allows for the execution of GitHub Actions. This could help alleviate some of the challenges faced when testing in different environments. The importance of documenting these processes is emphasized to ensure that developers can easily reproduce the necessary environments for testing.

[00:54:46] The need for built images from pull requests is mentioned, as this would allow developers to test changes that might potentially break existing functionality. The discussion highlights the importance of having accessible testing environments to facilitate smoother development processes and ensure the stability of the codebase.
[00:54:46] The discussion revolves around the importance of retrieving certain issues, particularly in relation to macOS. There is a suggestion to build images from pull requests (PRs) to facilitate testing by more people. This would allow individuals to test potentially breaking changes without relying solely on the ability of others to compile and fetch the PRs, which is currently limited to a small number of people.

[00:55:48] There is a mention of a recurring issue with someone experiencing crashes during the meeting. The group discusses the need to assess how much to increase storage space, indicating that this could be a useful step forward.

[00:56:22] One participant, Adrenion, returns to the conversation and mentions the possibility of creating a snap package from a specific pool. However, they express concerns about asking people to install the snap package just for testing, especially since it is limited to Linux and does not align with the CI environment. They emphasize that having the artifact available would still be beneficial.

[00:57:15] The next topic is about accepting bug reports on the forum. It is noted that some users prefer not to use GitHub for various reasons. Previously, there was a system in place on the forum for reporting bugs and submitting PRs, but it was canceled due to maintenance challenges. Now, Max, who is paid by the FPA to manage bug triage, is willing to open a section on the forum for bug reports, which would sync with GitHub issues while maintaining GitHub as the primary source of truth.

[00:58:36] David raises concerns about the synchronization workload between the forum and GitHub. He suggests that the process needs to be well-defined before implementation. He also questions the significance of the objections to GitHub, wondering if they come from a substantial number of users or just a few individuals. David points out that creating throwaway accounts on GitHub is easy and questions the necessity of a separate reporting system.

[01:01:01] Another participant agrees that while creating a bug report section on the forum could be beneficial, moving threads between sections could be problematic. They suggest that tagging issues as bugs might be a more effective solution than moving threads back and forth, which could confuse users.

[01:02:30] The discussion continues with a focus on the potential downsides of having multiple reporting platforms. It is emphasized that having a separate bug report section could dilute the focus on GitHub, which is currently the main platform for issue tracking. There is a consensus that encouraging users to report issues on GitHub is preferable, and that understanding the reasons behind users' reluctance to use GitHub is essential.

[01:04:18] One participant highlights that GitHub is not entirely free, as it involves data management and privacy concerns. They also mention that the platform is not just for bug reports but also for pull requests and other contributions. The conversation touches on the challenges faced by users who may not be able to navigate GitHub effectively.

[01:06:10] A case study is presented, illustrating how the current system works. It is noted that while users can raise issues in the forum, the process of transferring those issues to GitHub should be streamlined. The forum is seen as a more user-friendly environment for non-developers, and there is support for having a section dedicated to raising issues.

[01:08:10] The idea of experimenting with a separate reporting system is discussed, with the understanding that it could be a temporary measure. There is a suggestion to consider self-hosting a platform in the future, but the group acknowledges that more manpower is needed before such a transition can occur. David reiterates the importance of having a clear process for feedback and issue reporting to avoid confusion among users.
[01:09:33] A discussion was initiated regarding the feedback process for clients, emphasizing the importance of updates being communicated effectively. The need for a secure method of sharing updates was highlighted, particularly in relation to the forum and GitHub. 

[01:10:05] A developer was consulted about the continuation of discussions on GitHub, but it was noted that the initial reporter often does not engage on GitHub, which complicates the feedback loop. The developer expressed understanding of users' reluctance to create GitHub accounts but mentioned that users could still access GitHub in a read-only mode for updates.

[01:11:01] Concerns were raised about data security, with some participants expressing a preference for established companies like Microsoft over less known organizations. This sentiment was shared by others, indicating a divide in user trust regarding data handling.

[01:12:04] The conversation shifted to the potential for a bot to facilitate communication between PHP and GitHub, although there was caution against creating an automated system that could lead to issues. The current method of linking GitHub issues to forum threads was acknowledged as cumbersome but manageable.

[01:12:51] Peter briefly mentioned that some developers are uncomfortable using the forum, reinforcing the idea that GitHub remains the primary platform for issue tracking. The goal is to create a bridge for users to report issues more easily.

[01:14:10] Stonth supported the idea of improving the process of raising issues and suggested that many users read all issues on GitHub. There was a discussion about the potential for a manual to assist users in navigating the system.

[01:15:20] The use of PHPBB for the forum was mentioned, with acknowledgment that while automation is possible, it is not a priority due to resource constraints. The focus remains on simplicity and addressing immediate needs.

[01:16:41] The topic of file structure was introduced, with a presentation on a new file format that reuses the SCS format. Input from users was requested to refine the proposal before making it more formal.

[01:18:55] The discussion turned to the need for a proper MIME type for the new file format. Suggestions included using an "x-" prefix and exploring how other software, like Blender, handles MIME types. The importance of establishing a clear MIME type was emphasized.

[01:22:00] The topic of bounties was raised, with a reminder that there are still funds available for addressing blocking issues. Participants were encouraged to suggest issues that could benefit from a bounty.

[01:23:36] Dave introduced a concern regarding the organization of the codebase, particularly the GUI folder, which has become unwieldy with over 580 files. The need for better organization was stressed, especially as the project transitions to C++ version 20.

[01:25:12] The challenges of navigating the current file structure were discussed, with suggestions for organizing files by functionality to improve manageability. The importance of this organization for new developers was highlighted.

[01:27:04] An action item was proposed for Dave to open a GitHub issue to begin discussions on reorganizing the codebase, which he agreed to do.

[01:37:45] A new participant introduced themselves and expressed interest in engaging with the community. Concerns were raised about the management of the main branch and the quality of code, referencing feedback from Werner, who has been critical of recent changes.

[01:31:19] The conversation touched on forum moderation and the deletion of content, with a participant advocating for preserving valuable discussions and feedback to avoid discouraging users.

[01:32:07] Frank shared his work on API standardization for Python extensions and expressed a desire for feedback from the community. He mentioned that he has been documenting his findings and encouraged others to engage with the material.

[01:36:01] The potential for integrating Frank's documentation into the Wiki was discussed, with considerations about the differences in documentation style and the need for synchronization with the codebase. 

[01:37:42] The meeting concluded with a reminder that the session was recorded and that minutes would be made available, along with the chat content for reference.

    Ubuntu 20.04 LTS end of support is April 2025
    Ubuntu 22.04 has Qt6.2 but not PySide
    Supporting Qt5 takes significant developer effort
    When and how do we want to make the switch? 

David Carter says:I would argue for dropping "cute"  😄 

CorvusCorax says:the app images are going to have their own qt included, right? 

Jackson Oursland says:Yes.  The .AppImages contain the necessary dependencies, including Qt. 

reqrefusion says:In my language, kute means beating. 

stumpf says:for testing for self compling on debian it would be nice to have qt5, but not manadtory 

CorvusCorax says:is pyside6 installable via pip alongside system older pyside? 

stumpf says:because of pyside 

Benjamin Nauck (hyarion) says:kadet has been raising his hand for a long time 

Kacper Donat (kadet) says:There is like ton of hacks than we need for supporting both 

reqrefusion says:Kadet was one of those who participated in the most discussions regarding this issue. 

stumpf says:i would not use pip when you use apt or any other package manager, because it is very brittle 

stumpf says:in parallel just to be clear 

Kacper Donat (kadet) says:That is impossible 

Kacper Donat (kadet) says:But you can't here me

Benjamin Nauck (hyarion) says:just unpin it 

John O'Shaughnessy (JohnOCFII) says:I think someone started drawing on the whiteboard... unknowingly... 

reqrefusion says:Doubts regarding the recent changes with tolerances (stump, may not be able to join) 

reqrefusion says:That's what Article 6 is about. 

reqrefusion says:This meeting is more about goals and not about what to do. 

wandererfan says:is the tolerance change only in main (1.1.0) or is in v1.0? 

reqrefusion says:There may be more informative text on this subject.

David Carter says:Gone for coffee. Still listening 

wandererfan says:added to Wednesday FPA meeting -DISCUSS: post facto Grants 
From Sunday Dev Meeting - agenda item 4
Example was a bug fixer who doesn’t want to create a proposal until most of the work is done. 

Benjamin Nauck (hyarion) says:I think it is important to have a good "definition of done" for bounties, so there's no ambiguity if it is solved or not 

wandererfan says:"should" be caught by the merge process, but we could have a "warranty period" after the merge.  once that post merge period ends, we cut the cheque. 

David Carter says:First Jitsi crash of the day 

wandererfan says:FPA agenda item 19 DISCUSS: grants for upstream project work 

Benjamin Nauck (hyarion) says:It would be good, as a non-windows user, to be able to download a windows build of a branch for testing it on a friends windows computer. 

wandererfan says:I use VirtualBox to run a Windows VM for this, but it is painful. 

Benjamin Nauck (hyarion) says:being able to allow people test an artifact would decrease the need to merge to main for testing too 

stumpf says:true +1 

David Carter says:All I'm hearing is "cabin in the woods". Sorry 

CorvusCorax says:one issue is, to make an account on github - even a temporary or throwaway from, you have to agree to the terms of conditions of github. if you can not or do not want to agree to these conditions, you can't make an account 

David Carter says:👍 

Kacper Donat (kadet) says:👍 

CorvusCorax says:Microsoft does not exactly have a good track record with keeping customer data secure 

Kacper Donat (kadet) says:Sure, but neither does random admin from the 

Kacper Donat (kadet) says:from the internet* 

Kacper Donat (kadet) says:Have to go! Good week to you all! 

reqrefusion says:Bye 

David Carter says:Or company random addmin sells to 

David Carter says:A linear increase in platforms is an exponential increase in the required effort. The justification needs to be compelling and so far I dont think it is
