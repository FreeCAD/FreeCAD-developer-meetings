# FreeCAD Developer Meeting Summary - October 18, 2025

This document summarizes the FreeCAD developer meeting held on October 18, 2025. The primary focus was on the status of the 1.1 release, the grant program, and addressing open blocker bugs. The discussion also touched on improving developer experience and the implications of a FreeCAD fork.

## 1.1 Release Status and Blocker Bugs

The meeting began with a discussion of the 1.1 release status. There are approximately 30 identified blockers, but it was suggested that about 10 of these could potentially be downgraded in severity. This would leave around 20 critical bugs that need to be addressed before the release.

*   **Identifying Blockers:** A "blocker" label is used in the issue tracker
*   **Specific Blockers:**
    *   Regression on slicing of slice (22827): This is considered a significant regression that should be bisectable, but hasn't been addressed.
    *   Transparency bug (18584): This is a file migration bug for which a potential fix exists, but an alternate path forward was originally preferred. That never materialized, so there was consensus towards revisiting the originally-proposed solution from @wwmayer.
*   **Action Plan:** The team decided to review the list of blockers and make decisions on downgrading or re-evaluating their status.

Transitioning from the immediate release concerns, the discussion shifted to the FPA grant program and its effectiveness.

## FreeCAD Grant Program Discussion

The participants discussed the effectiveness and direction of the FreeCAD project association's grant program. Concerns were raised about the program's lack of focus and the need for more targeted funding.

*   **Current State:** The program tends to fund most proposals, which may not always align with the most critical development needs.
*   **Chris's Perspective:** Funding should shift away from the free-for-all grant system and towards the targetted positions the FPA funds such as Bug Triage Coordinator, Release Manager, etc.
*   **Frank's Perspective:** Focus should be placed on code quality and developer experience, as developers are also users of FreeCAD. He highlighted the poor developer experience in areas such as compiling, setting up IDEs, and inconsistent APIs.
*   **Pieter's Perspective:** There is a need to allow volunteer developers to work on features they find interesting, while also ensuring that less popular but necessary tasks like bug fixes are addressed.
*   **Proposed Changes:**
    *   Shift towards targeted funding based on focus areas identified by working groups or task forces.
    *   Create specific, funded positions for developers to work on particular areas, such as bug fixing or documentation.
    *   Empower workbench maintainers or task groupss to allocate budget to address friction points and recruit developers for specific tasks.
*   **Onboarding New Contributors:** It was noted that the difficulty of contributing to FreeCAD may deter potential grant applicants. Improving the onboarding experience for new developers is crucial.
*   **Community Liaison:** The idea of an FPA-funded community liaison was proposed to guide new contributors and connect them with experts in specific areas of the codebase.

## FreeCAD Trademark and xCAD Fork

The meeting addressed the issue of a FreeCAD fork called xCAD and the implications of trademarking the "FreeCAD" name.

*   **xCAD:** There was some concern that the xCAD developers seemed to be planning to release their version as "FreeCAD 2.0" (though with a new logo). This later appeared not to be the case, but prompted discussion about possible ensuing confusion.
*   **Trademark Status:** The FreeCAD trademark currently only covers the logo, not the name "FreeCAD".
*   **Community Concerns:** There was concern that having multiple projects using the same name could cause confusion for users.
*   **Proposed Action:** It was suggested that the FPA investigate the possibility of trademarking the name "FreeCAD," although the feasibility of this was questioned.
*   **Counter-Argument:** Some argued that focusing on improving the existing FreeCAD project and maintaining a strong community is the best approach, and not worrying about what the xCAD team does.

The meeting then returned to the list of open blocker bugs for the 1.1 release.

## Review of Open Blockers (Continued)

The team continued to review the list of open blocker bugs, making decisions on their severity and potential solutions.

*   **Spreadsheet Control-A Crash (15673):** Downgraded from blocker status.
*   **Core, Toggling Transparency, Reset Colors (18075):** Left as a blocker due to a potential fix.
*   **FEM simple ccx fluid section example not working anymore:** Left as a blocker with a trivial fix of removing the example if necessary.
*   **Open a file created in SD 0.21.2 containing part workbench Boolean cut operation:** Left as a blocker due to a potential fix from Werner.
*   **Step, export missing color when exporting body or parts (19336):** Left as a blocker as a solution is proposed.
*   **Exception local coordinate system origin doesn't contain feature with role XZ plane (20465):** Downgraded from blocker status due to inability to reproduce.
*   **Regression declined drag and drop lets objects vanish:** Left as a blocker.
*   **FEM running Elmer Solver always freezes FreeCAD in the Windows Weekly:** Left as a blocker.
*   **Style sheets. All UI arrows are missing:** Removed from blocker status.
*   **Style sheet requested non-existent:** Left as a blocker.
*   **Sketcher constraining error when applying measure in a specific way cannot set the datum because the sketch contains conflicting constraints:** Left as a blocker.
*   **Core duplicate object label with linked object despite disabled in settings:** Left as a blocker.
*   **Tech draw detail view angle dimension problem:** Left as a blocker.

At the end of the process, 19 open blockers remained. Of those, 11 have open PRs, two others have solutions in progress but not yet open PRs, and so six remain to be focused on.

## Conclusion

The FreeCAD developer meeting addressed several key issues, including the upcoming 1.1 release, the effectiveness of the grant program, and the potential impact of a FreeCAD fork. The team made progress in evaluating and prioritizing blocker bugs for the 1.1 release, and discussed potential improvements to the grant program to better align funding with strategic development goals. The possibility of trademarking the "FreeCAD" name was raised, but no immediate action was taken. The next steps include Kacper creating the branch next Wednesday and the team will continue to address the remaining blocker bugs and prepare for the 1.1 release.
