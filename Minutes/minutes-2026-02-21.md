## AstoCAD Publicity

The meeting began with a discussion on a proposal by @PaddleStroke (Pierre-Louis Boyer) to include the word "AstoCAD" as the default text for new text objects within the Sketcher workbench during development.
- The proposal aimed to promote Pierre's AstoCAD project, a soft fork of FreeCAD.
- Kacper raised concerns about user confusion and potential drama on forums if "AstoCAD" appeared as default text.
- He suggested alternative promotional methods like blog mentions and splash screen inclusions.
- John sought clarity on the acceptability of splash screen advertisements.
- The group agreed to avoid using "AstoCAD" as default text but supported promoting Pierre's work through other means.

## Robot Workbench Maintenance

Gaël Écorchard (@galou, @galou_breizh) proposed becoming a maintainer for the Robot Workbench.
- Jackson noted the workbench's lack of recent development and questioned its current value.
- He suggested incorporating Gaël's work or Dr. Phinexian's Robot CAD.
- Carlo (@onekk) has also been working on the Robot Workbench, and was suggested as someone to touch base with.
- The consensus was that Gaël can contribute to the Robot Workbench, with code review from other members, and should participat in any code review of other developers' work on that Workbench.

## File Saving Dialogue

Billy proposed adding a dialogue when saving files created by older versions to warn users about possible incompatibility issues.
- The dialogue would warn users about potential problems when opening newer files in older versions.
- Kacper suggested including a "don't show again" checkbox to avoid repeated prompts.
- John suggested the dialogue should always inform the user where to find the setting that's being disabled.
- The consensus was to add the dialogue but not include it in the immediate 1.1 release due to time constraints.
- It was decided to create a PR for further evaluation and potential inclusion in a future release.

## Python API 2.0

Frank (@mnesarco) introduced the topic of updating the FreeCAD Python API.
- He emphasized the need for explicit separation between the old and new APIs.
- Frank suggested exploring different naming conventions and package structures.
- He proposed aligning the Python API with the C++ design, separating app and GUI components.
- Discussion covered the challenge of versioning and maintaining compatibility with existing add-ons.
- John suggested using a camel case naming scheme.
- Jackson expressed concern about restricting access to the core API.
- Chris Hennes (@chennes) suggested tabling the topic for a dedicated meeting in 3-4 weeks' time. He will work with Frank and John to set a time and publicize it to developers.

## AI Integration

Steve (@mabeesteve) raised concerns about the potential integration of AI features into FreeCAD.
- He requested an option to completely hide AI-related UI elements.
- John opposed including AI features in the FreeCAD core, suggesting they be implemented as add-ons.
- Jackson supported a FEP stating that no core functionality depends on external third-party services.
- Kacper suggested marking add-ons that use AI with a clear label.
- The consensus was to allow AI in add-ons, with clear labeling and user consent.
- The group decided to move forward with Steve's FEP on AI integration, which would require any such integration to have an opt-out option.

## macOS Support Policy

Jackson discussed issues with weekly releases of FreeCAD on older macOS devices.
- The minimum macOS version was bumped to version 12 due to Qt updates.
- A community member made a PR for 6.7 builds for older hardware.
- The discussion covered how old of macOS devices that FreeAD should support.
- Kacper suggested supporting the latest Ubuntu LTS and treating older systems on a "best effort" basis.
- It's noted that Ubuntu 24.04 internally maintains version 6.4.
- Kacper suggested making third-party software available, but not officially supported.
- The group agreed it should not have dependencies with security issues.
- Jackson will take the discussion back to the PR and the thoughts there.

## Other Business
- The issue about asynchronous document recompute and multi-threading infrastructure will be discussed in the FEP, which may be split into two parts. The related PR is ready for merge and does not require the FEP to be completed.
- John mentioned that there is an open PR with a change from `#ifndef`-based header guards to `#pragma once` statements -- there were no stated objections to the shift.
