# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Saturday, 21 February 2026 16:30h UTC**

Meeting link: https://meet.jit.si/FreeCAD-devs-meeting

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes**
   - An FPA admin will begin the recording
   - Will try to make introductions today, both for newcomers and so the AI knows what's going on

2. **Giving credit to AstoCAD** - chennes
   - @PaddleStroke has an important [new feature PR](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/22217) to add text objects to Sketcher
   - He has proposed making the default inserted text "AstoCAD" during the development process, to be changed before the next release
      - He would like to promote his AstoCAD soft-fork, which needs additional exposure to make successful
   - Other ideas include:
      - Making a splashscreen about the new feature that thanks AstoCAD
      - Making a splashscreen about AstoCAD itself
      - Including AstoCAD in the program credits
      - Mentioning AstoCAD and using its name as the text presenting this feature in the release notes and on the blog

3. **Gaël Écorchard (galou, galou_breizh) as maintainer of the Robot Workbench**
   - Gaël proposes himself.
   - There's not much going up right now but Gaël'd like to make more changes as he finds some time.
   - Gaël doesn't think there's any maintainer of this workbench right now.

4. **Add Warning dialog when saving out a v1.0.x file from a v1.1/v1.2** - Connor
   - With topo changes a file can become incompatable with v1.0.x
   - CAM has introduced new features that can break older files when saved from v1.2/v1.2 (Toolbits, changes to opeartions etc)

5. **Guidelines (requirement?) that AI features can be completely disabled and avoided by Users** - MabeeSteve
   - Related to brief [Discord discussion with hyarion (nauck)](https://discord.com/channels/870877411049357352/1099444468895199232/1471915084426252321)
   - Addition and inclusion of "AI" features in established software is a sensitive matter that warrants careful, deliberate handling to avoid tension and user issues
   - Can't stop AI, it's going to happen, but we can manage it to mitigate disruption and user discontent
   - Initial thoughts:
      1. Develop a policy using the FEP process
      2. Policy would apply to core features and add-ons
      3. All AI features (including any UI widgets) can be disabled fully via application preferences
      4. Any AI feature that sends data to external services would be explicitly opt-in
      5. All AI features would be disabled by default (don't make users play whack-a-mole)
      6. MabeeSteve is willing to write the FEP

6. **FreeCAD Python API 2.0** - Mnesarco
   - Namespacing is a controversial topic, legacy must be maintained so new API needs its own root to avoid conflicts.
      - CamelCase (from C++ culture) vs pep8 from python culture.
      - (Legacy) No root namespaces: import Part, import Draft, etc..
      - pep8 indirections in freecad namespace: import freecad.app, freecad.part, etc... (freecad root is also used by addons, may be conflicts)
      - New root for new api (examples):
         - import freecadapi.part
         - import freecad.api.part
         - import freecad.ext.part
         - import freecad2.part
         - import fcad.part
         - import fc.part
         - import fcx.part
      - App and Gui separation (or not):
         - import fc.part.app.X, import fc.part.gui.Y
         - from fc.app import part, from fc.gui import part
   - Api Versioning
      - Distributed by pypi.org as official packages
      - Support Multiple installed versions (different addons can use different versions) - probably not possible
      - Annotation based deprecations and versioning (good docs, automated checks)
   - Event management
      - Current: Specific Observers (Fat observers), not homogeneous
      - Proposal: Global Event Bus (subscription by topic, matchers, simple listeners, One api to rule them all)
         - Example: `subs = fc.events.document.recompute(lambda doc: print(doc.Name))`
         - Automatic or manual lifecycle management (`subs.unsubscribe()` or garbage collected)
         - Managed state: context based suppression, single shot, etc..
   - Strong typing
      - Enums vs strings
   - Declarative vs imperative
   - Test framework ready for core, addons, app, gui
   - Generated documentation (Sphinx vs pydoc vs mkdocstrings)

7. **macOS Version Support** - oursland
   - Qt 6.8 (LTS) bumped minimum version to macOS 12 (macOS 15 to build) [source](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.8/macos.html)
   - This restricts to platforms released in 2015 (2018 to build) [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro#macOS)
   - @ipatch and @graelo have been working on changes to build and release against Qt 6.7 to support macOS 11, bringing FreeCAD to devices manufactured in 2013
   - Qt 6.7 is not a LTS release and has been out of support (OSS and paid) for over a year
   - Which vintage of macOS devices do we want to support with releases?  10 years old?
