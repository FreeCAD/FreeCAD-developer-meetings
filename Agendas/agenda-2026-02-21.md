# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Saturday, 21 February 2026 16:30h UTC**

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes**
   - An FPA admin will begin the recording
   - Will try to make introductions today, both for newcomers and so the AI knows what's going on

2. **Giving credit to AstoCAD** - chennes
   - @PaddleStroke has an important [new feature PR](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/22217) to add text objects to Sketcher
   - He has proposed making the default inserted text "AstoCAD" during the development process, to be changed before the next release
       - He would like to promote his AstoCAD soft-fork, which needs additional exposure to make successful
   - Other ideas include:
       - Making a splashscreen about the new feature that thanks AstoCAD
       - Making a splashscreen about AstoCAD itself
       - Including AstoCAD in the program credits
