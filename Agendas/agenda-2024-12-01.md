# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Sunday, 1 December 2024**

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes**
   - An FPA admin needs to log into the FPA Gmail account and then to the screenapp.io account to record
2. **GitHub Issue Action for Stale Issues** (maxwxyz)
   - Adding the actions/stale to help keep the GitHub repository organized and automatically identify/close stale issues.
   - PR: https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/18074
3. **Issues raised from FPA admin meeting** (sliptonic)
   - What are the development community's priorities for the next development cycle?
       - FPA will set a 'Top n funding goals'   We would like these to be consistent but not necessarily the same thing because the FPA funds things besides FreeCAD code.
       - FreeCAD development community does better with specific goals.  Historically (toponaming, Py3, Qt5, etc)
   - Do we need to revisit our formal release decision processes in light of our post-1.0 status
       - When do we go to 2.0 vs. 1.n ?
       - If 2.0 is going to be like 1.0, what should its goals be? (1.0's goals were internal Assembly Workbench and Toponaming mitigation)
5. **Add chapter with C++ recommended practices in developer handbook** (kadet and hyarion)
   - PR: https://github.com/FreeCAD/DevelopersHandbook/pull/107

6. **CWG: New file format** (pierreporte)
   - In principe, reusing FCStd with more structured attributes has been validated
   - Next goal: writing down how FreeCAD should behave when new files are opened
  
7. **CWG: Cosmetic threads** (pierreporte)
   - Last talked about on October 6, goal was to define UI/UX
   - [Figma prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/nDkUKcH1YgriUSRG2EInYj/FreeCAD-Dialogs?node-id=247-6670&node-type=canvas&t=dTEcRC8eJWuwnGsA-0&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=247%3A6670&show-proto-sidebar=1) has been done, inspired by Catia but improved
   - Same feature for external and internal threads, it detects automatically what thread to make
   - It can still be improved but it can already work
   - Work has startet to overhaul the hole tool:
       - Initially, to integrate cosmetic threads
       - Extended into a full overhaul to make it easier to use
       - Still a lot of work to do
