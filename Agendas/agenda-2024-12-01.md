3. **Issues raised from FPA admin meeting** (sliptonic)
   - What are the development community's priorities for the next development cycle?
       - FPA will set a 'Top n funding goals'   We would like these to be consistent but not necessarily the same thing because the FPA funds things besides FreeCAD code.
       - FreeCAD development community does better with specific goals.  Historically (toponaming, Py3, Qt5, etc)
   - Do we need to revisit our formal release decision processes in light of our post-1.0 status
       - When do we go to 2.0 vs. 1.n ?
