# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Sunday, 1 December 2024**

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes**
   - An FPA admin needs to log into the FPA Gmail account and then to the screenapp.io account to record
2. **GitHub Issue Action for Stale Issues** (maxwxyz)
   - Adding the actions/stale to help keep the GitHub repository organized and automatically identify/close stale issues.
   - PR: https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/18074
3. Issues raised from FPA admin meeting (sliptonic)
   - What are the development community's priorities for the next development cycle?
       - FPA will set a 'Top n funding goals'   We would like these to be consistent but not necessarily the same thing because the FPA funds things besides FreeCAD code.
       - FreeCAD development community does better with specific goals.  Historically (toponaming, Py3, Qt5, etc)
   - Do we need to revisit our formal release decision processes in light of our post-1.0 status
       - When do we go to 2.0 vs. 1.n ?
