# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Saturday, 16 November 2024**

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes** (chennes)
   - An FPA admin needs to log into the FPA gMail account and then to the screenapp.io account to record
2. **Including external Workbenches in the package somehow**(reqrefusion)
   - Some external workbenches provide features that cannot be considered separate from such a program, but incorporating them requires a process. There are also [some reservations](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=790032#p789810) about including it in the main code.
   - My solution is to select some external workbenches such as theme selection at the first startup and download them automatically.
3. **Merging PRs post 1.0**(reqrefusion)
   - Now the 1.0 process is about to be completed, but there is a lot of PR postponed until after 1.0, this was mentioned at the last PR meeting. A solution is needed to get through this process painlessly.
   - My solution, the first one that comes to mind, is to increase the PR meetings to two for a few weeks. In this way, long meetings can be prevented and normal order can be returned afterwards.
