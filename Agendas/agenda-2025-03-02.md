# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Sunday, 02 March 2025**

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes**
   - An FPA admin will begin the recording

2. **CAD Working Group** (pierreporte)
   - An official PDM for FreeCAD?

3. **Coin3D is holding us back** (oursland)
   - Recent profiling of major slowdowns and hangs have both been traced to inefficiencies in Coin3D's scenegraph.
   - Current project to replace the renderer will not improve matters.
   - Options:
      - Fix Coin3D
      - Replace Coin3D
         - Other SceneGraph library: e.g. OpenSceneGraph or VulkanSceneGraph
         - Alternative system such as Godot game engine
   - First steps regardless:
      - Vendor Coin3D
      - Fix immediate issues, even if hack

4. **Repository Naming** (PhoneDroid)
   - New repositories in the `FreeCAD` organization shouldn't be prefixed with `FreeCAD-`.
   - Muddling FreeCAD repository names for the convenience of people that fork them is not justified.
   - People that fork repositories:
      - Are given the option to rename the fork
      - Can rename their fork post fork without issue
   - Renaming existing FreeCAD repositories is difficult so names should be proper to begin with.
