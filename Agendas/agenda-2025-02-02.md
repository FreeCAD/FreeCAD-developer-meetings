# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Sunday, 02 February 2025**

1. **FOSDEM 2025**
   - Many FreeCAD developers, maintainers, and admins are at the [Free Open-Source Software Developers European Meetup (FOSDEM)](https://fosdem.org/2025/) today and will not be able to attend this meeting. In particular, no one with access to start the screenapp.io recording will be present, so minutes will need to be taken manually, or the meeting manually recorded. This should be coordinated before going further so that there is an accurate recounting available to those unable to attend.
