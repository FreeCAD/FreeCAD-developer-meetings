# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Saturday, 19 July 2025 1530h UTC**

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes**
   - An FPA admin will begin the recording
   - Will try to make introductions today, both for newcomers and so the AI knows what's going on
  
2. **Actions and decisions of working groups are too opaque** - @Roy-043
   - One of the problems of the FreeCAD community is that it has become insular. Groups have turned their back on the forum and have discussions on different platforms instead. But their actions and decisions then do impact the project and other contributors. This can easily lead to conflicts. We need to re-examine this practice.
  
3. **Update from FAB25** - @chennes and @pieterhijma
