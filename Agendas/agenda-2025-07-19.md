# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Saturday, 19 July 2025 1530h UTC**

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes**
   - An FPA admin will begin the recording
   - Will try to make introductions today, both for newcomers and so the AI knows what's going on
  
2. **Actions and decisions of working groups are too opaque** - @Roy-043
   - One of the problems of the FreeCAD community is that it has become insular. Groups have turned their back on the forum and have discussions on different platforms instead. But their actions and decisions then do impact the project and other contributors. This can easily lead to conflicts. We need to re-examine this practice.
  
3. **Update from FAB25** - @chennes and @pieterhijma

4. **BIM workbench, degraded user experience on 1.0.1** - @furgo16
   - I'm not able to attend the meetings live, apologies. I hope adding the item here is appropriate, even in an async capacity.
   - https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/21422. In summary, the issue is fixed but was missed for the 1.0.1 release.
   - Some BIM contributors are advocating for a backport and a 1.0.2 release including it.
   - The negative impact, particularly on new users, is considerable. The fix is simple and has been road-tested.
   - Concerns about the undeserved "unstable" reputation the BIM workbench might be gaining as a result.
