# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Saturday, 21 December 2024**

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes**
   - An FPA admin needs to log into the FPA Gmail account and then to the screenapp.io account to record
2. Re-branding this meeting (sliptonic)
   - The bi-weekly developer meetings are generally informational.  There's no formal decision making part of the agenda
   - There is currently no formal meeting of 'Maintainers'.  It is Maintainers who are responsible for decision making about the direction of the FreeCAD source.
   - PROPOSAL:
     - Make this a bi-weekly 'Maintainers Meeting'
     - Keep it open to all participants and especially encourage formal maintainers to attend
     - Add formal decision topics to the agenda.
       - What is the next release date?  (feature freeze, string freeze, etc)
