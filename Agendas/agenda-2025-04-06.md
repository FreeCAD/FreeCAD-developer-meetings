# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Saturday, 6 April 2025**

(**NOTE**: Most of North America is now in Daylight Saving Time/Summer Time, while most of Europe is not. This meeting is scheduled in Central European Time, so for those in North America it is one hour later than normal.)

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes**
   - An FPA admin will begin the recording
   - Will try to make introductions today, both for newcomers and so the AI knows what's going on

2. **Moving the Addon Manager to a submodule** (chennes)
   - Addon Manager is 100% Python
   - Some internal AM code is needed by external cache-generation tools
   - As an external repo it could potentially update itself

3. **OCCT Liaison topics** (Pieter Hijma)
   - Introduce myself as OCCT Liaison
   - Discuss FreeCAD support for OCCT versions
   - [#19795](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/19795)
   - [Commercial Data Exchange](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=95294)

4. **Enabling Copilot** (chennes)
   - Right now Microsoft Copilot is disabled at the org level (default setting)
   - Enabling would give us access to AI PR reviews
   - Is this a thing we want to experiment with?

5. **Telemetry Project** (chennes)
   - Telemetry addon is in "soft-launch"
   - Additional testers needed
   - Help needed creating public-facing "dashboard" from data

6. **Documenting procedure for changing deps** (hyarion)
   - We seem to forget to inform people when changing which version of ubuntu we want to target.
   - Failing dev builds as consequence
   - Can we document the procedure needed to avoid issues?

7. **Addons to augment core functionality** (sliptonic)
   - It would be nice for creators to be able to create addons that do things like:
      - add TechDraw templates
      - new CAM post processors
   - This means either the addon has to write into non-MOD directories or the workbenches need to be able to find the added assets in MOD.  Either way, some development guidance is needed.
  
8. **File format "compatibility mode"** (chennes)
   - wwmayer had proposed this: https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/18761/files
   - makes a one-way conversion based on current running version of FreeCAD
   - would be better if it was reversable, or we had the ability to save as a 1.0 file
   - anyone interested in coding this?
