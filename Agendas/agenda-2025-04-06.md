# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Sunday, 6 April 2025**

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes**
   - An FPA admin will begin the recording
   - Will try to make introductions today, both for newcomers and so the AI knows what's going on

2. **The new FreeCAD Enhancement Proposals - RFC Process for FreeCAD** (kadet)
   - We struggle with making hard and well informed decisions, so we need some process to help us
   - The need for the process was already discussed: https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-developer-meetings/blob/main/Minutes/minutes-2024-12-21.md
   - Proposal for how the process could look: https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-Enhancement-Proposals/pull/12

3. **API Stability/Maturity per module** (kadet)
   - Some parts of FreeCAD are more stable than others
   - For new modules it is very hard to come up with good API without seeing it in the wild
   - Other software suites (like kubernetes) specify API maturity per module, for example Deployments can be stable while Gateway API is not
   - This would make easier to merge changes with non-perfect API as we will be able to change API in the future
   - Good candidate for FEP!
  
4. **Google Summer of Code** (chennes)
   - Introductions from any GSoC attendees
  
5. **Telemetry Help Wanted** (chennes)
   - Need web help for displaying the results to the public

6. **Setting dates for App, Gui, Part, and PartDesign reformat** (chennes)
   - These formatting changes are going to be BIG
   - PR authors will want to manually run pre-commit before trying to rebase
   - Want to give plenty of advance notice
   - Consider changes to style - like disabling alignment - that is best time to do it

7. **BIM and Draft reformat** (marcuspollio, kadet)
   - Some python workbenches could use automatic formatting too
   - BIM and Draft are the biggest - we should focus on them first
   - Suggestion: Increase line width to 100 from the default 88

8. **Weekly Builds** (oursland)
   - PR open to merge weekly builds into main branch [(PR#20415)](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/20415)
      - Tags for each build to easily reference a build to a commit
         - Can `git bisect` between weeklies to identify and resolve bugs
      - GitHub releases for each build
        - Clearly marked as a Weekly build and as "pre-release" status, not to be confused with an official release
        - Archives of previous releases
   - Recently addressed on my fork's main branch
      - macOS Signing in CI
         - Requires a GitHub `environment` with secrets
            - [ ] New build certificate for weekly releases
            - [ ] New build provisioning profile for weekly releases
            - [ ] New app-specific password for the weekly releases
   - Outstanding Concerns
      - Tagging conventions
         - Current tagging scheme makes regex matching of release tags from other tags less than ideal
         - Current releases are X.Y.Z, but propose using **v**X.Y.Z including adding these tags to previous releases
         - Weekly releases proposal: weekly-YYYY.MM.DD
       
9. **Addon Manager Namespace** (PhoneDroid)
   - Addon manager seems to be hardcoded to the old namespace ( https://wiki.freecad.org/Package_Metadata )
   - Addon manager seems to error out if any package has a different namespace  
      ( if anyone could cross check I'd appreciate it )
   - Addon manager shouldn't care for the namespace, it doesn't ensure  
      the structure anyways ( only validates in the developers IDE )  
   - The new addon manifest schema has a different namespace
