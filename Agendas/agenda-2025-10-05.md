# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Saturday, 5 October 2025 1530h UTC**

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes**
   - An FPA admin will begin the recording
   - Will try to make introductions today, both for newcomers and so the AI knows what's going on

2. **AI generated code policy** (yorik)
   - Proposed AI policy: https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/24126

3. **Removing the Robot Workbench** (chennes, cannot attend meeting)
   - Robot workbench contains many files without copyright notices, these are likely "All rights reserved".
   - Without those files there is not much remaining of the workbench
   - Proposal to remove it: https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/24119
