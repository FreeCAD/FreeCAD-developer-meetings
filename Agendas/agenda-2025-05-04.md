# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Sunday, 4 May 2025**

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes**
   - An FPA admin will begin the recording
   - Will try to make introductions today, both for newcomers and so the AI knows what's going on

2. **Drawing module, keep or remove (redux)** (chennes)
   - Drawing module was already set to default OFF
   - So are we ready to remove source?

3. **Submodule vs. Subtree** (chennes/oursland)
   - In the last meeting @oursland advocated for a subtree-based approach
   - Further comments before planning to migrate to subtrees?
 
4. **North American Meetup 2025** (chennes)
   - Dates confirmed: second weekend in August, Friday Aug 8 - Saturday Aug 9.
   - Springfield, IL, USA

5. **Proposal for larger feature merge** (davesrocketshop)
   - Currently 5 months in to merge of 1 month of development with more to go
      - individual merges taking 2-3 weeks or more, a problem when breaking it down into smaller PRs
   - Propose appointment of a maintainer as a "merge manager" for larger feature merges
   - Dev provides an online walk through of the code for reviewers and interested parties (CWG, DWG, others)
   - Out of band from the weekly merge meetings
      - target days per PR instead of weeks allowing for multiple small merges
      - maintainer may opt for larger PRs
      - Up to the maintainer to ensure reviews are done in a timely fashion
