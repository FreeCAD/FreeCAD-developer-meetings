# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Sunday, 20 December 2025 16:30h UTC**

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes**
   - An FPA admin will begin the recording
   - Will try to make introductions today, both for newcomers and so the AI knows what's going on
  
2. **An exception for Feature Freeze-[Assembly: Change Joint References to remove cyclic dependency](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/25513)** (reqrefusion)
   - A PR required for backward or forward compatibility
   - Highly recommended by Worbench's maintainer
   - Assembly is a fairly new workbench
   -  The Feature Freeze process has already taken longer, it seems that it will take a little longer, it is possible to handle it
   -  Paddle assures that it will fix the problems here
   -  Feature Freeze is of course very clear, but the necessary conditions have been met to make an exception

3. **FEP-0006 Materials Editor** (davesrocketshop)
   - Introduction to a revamped materials editor
   - The original editor was written quickly with minimal functionality
   - This FEP is for a more complete editor incorporating lessons learned
