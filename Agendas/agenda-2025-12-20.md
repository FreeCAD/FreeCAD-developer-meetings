# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Sunday, 20 December 2025 16:30h UTC**

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes**
   - An FPA admin will begin the recording
   - Will try to make introductions today, both for newcomers and so the AI knows what's going on

2. **An exception for Feature Freeze-[Assembly: Change Joint References to remove cyclic dependency](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/25513)** (reqrefusion)
   - A PR required for backward or forward compatibility
   - Highly recommended by Worbench's maintainer
   - Assembly is a fairly new workbench
   -  The Feature Freeze process has already taken longer, it seems that it will take a little longer, it is possible to handle it
   -  Paddle assures that it will fix the problems here
   -  Feature Freeze is of course very clear, but the necessary conditions have been met to make an exception

3. **FEP-0006 Materials Editor** (davesrocketshop)
   - Introduction to a revamped materials editor
   - The original editor was written quickly with minimal functionality
   - This FEP is for a more complete editor incorporating lessons learned

4. **Generic Collaboration Framework** (pieterhijma)
   - Working on a generic collaboration framework in FreeCAD
	 - Issues [#25681](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/25681), [#25682](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/25682), [#25685](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/25685)
	 - [PR #26306](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/26306)
		 - introduces a Collaboration module with a `Collaboration::Topic`, a label in the 3D view
		 - has a task panel that can hold a "conversation", a list of comments (future work)
	 - Idea is that this framework is extensible for different uses
   - potential users of this framework:
	 - [Ondsel Lens Addon](https://github.com/FreeCAD/Ondsel-Lens-Addon/)
	 - PDM systems, such as [FreePDM](https://github.com/grd/FreePDM)
	 - [BCF plugin](https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/)
   - The Collaboration module contains both Python and C++ code
	 - Python code in separate modules
		 - so there is the `Collaboration` python package (C++ code)
		 - and the `collaboration` package with for example
           `collaboration.gui.components`.
