5. **FEP-0004: Python API Versioning** - @oursland
   - Placeholder proposal to implement API versioning
   - Intended to set versioning for APIs to:
      - inform developers when an API is deprecated or obsoleted and when it will be removed
      - add-ons declare API versions used to ensure compatibility on a fine-grained basis
    
6. **User Manual** - @oursland
   - The wiki is not great due to it's out-of-sync nature and lack of versioning
   - I recall someone is migrating from wiki to a Markdown based static site, what's the status and how can we keep things versioned and current?

7. **Text Style Standardization** - hyarion
   - Proposal for language style guidelines from the Design Working Group
   - Based on APA standards, multiple platform guidelines, and meta-analysis of common CAD software practices
   - Implementation has begun, but remains open to discussion or objections before continuing more broadly
