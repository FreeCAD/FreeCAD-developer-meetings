# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Sunday, 06 July 2025 1530h UTC**

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes**
   - An FPA admin will begin the recording
   - Will try to make introductions today, both for newcomers and so the AI knows what's going on
     
2. **Codebase reformatting** - @kadet1090
   - changes to existing style were proposed - https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/21019
   - some modules (both C++ and Python) still need to be formatted
   - when to merge changes?
   - how to deal with conflicts, especially for larger forks?
