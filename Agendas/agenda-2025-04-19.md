# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Sunday, 19 April 2025**

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes**
   - An FPA admin will begin the recording
   - Will try to make introductions today, both for newcomers and so the AI knows what's going on

2. **Drawing module, keep or remove** (hyarion)
   - Drawing mod has been kept for backwards compatibility. Is this something we want to continue with or should we remove it as proposed by mosfet?
   - during merge meeting it was decided to discuss it here instead
