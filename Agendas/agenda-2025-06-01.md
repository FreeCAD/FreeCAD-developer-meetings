# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Sunday, 1 June 2025 1530h UTC**

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes**
   - An FPA admin will begin the recording
   - Will try to make introductions today, both for newcomers and so the AI knows what's going on

2. **Discuss possible license issue with bundling IfcOpenShell** (yorik)
    - IfcOpenShell is LGPL3, would make our packages become LGPL3 too. Why not, but it needs to be assessed...
    - https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/21204
    - might be a good opportunity to re-assess all the bundled packages licenses...

3. **KiCon Recap** (oursland)
   - Jackson attended KiCon North America 2025 in San Diego and talked to people.
   - Many people use FreeCAD, and one even gave a talk on it (KiConnect).

4. **Pub-Sub Messaging System** (oursland)
   - A couple of addons are now developing competing mechanisms for communicating between FreeCAD and other software (i.e. KiCad and Blender)
   - KiCad 9 now has an IPC API based upon Protocol Buffers and NNG messaging.
   - Would a standardized means for network based APIs benefit the FreeCAD community?
   - Would a pub-sub system be appropriate?

5. **OCCT Liaison Update** (pieterhijma)
   - Talked with OCCT
   - They and the FPA are currently interested in collaboration on the Data Exchange Wrapper
	 - see [User Guide DE Wrapper](https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/overview/html/occt_user_guides__de_wrapper.html)
	 - see [Data Exchange Formats](https://occt3d.com/data-exchange-formats/)
   - Two possible approaches (haven't discussed the technical details yet, but this is what I think to understand):
     1. Change the current read/write interface to `DE_Wrapper`
		- load additional DLLs into our OCCT libraries
		- support configuration to use these libraries
		- needs binary compatibility between plugins and OCC
	 2. Use a separate application that has OCC linked
		 - load additional DLLs into this OCCT version
		 - stream the resulting file as .xbf files
   - Anyone interested, can the FPA incentivize this?
