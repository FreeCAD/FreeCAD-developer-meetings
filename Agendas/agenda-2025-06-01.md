# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Sunday, 1 June 2025 1530h UTC**

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes**
   - An FPA admin will begin the recording
   - Will try to make introductions today, both for newcomers and so the AI knows what's going on

2. **Discuss possible license issue with bundling IfcOpenShell** (yorik)
    - IfcOpenShell is LGPL3, would make our packages become LGPL3 too. Why not, but it needs to be assessed...
    - https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/21204
    - might be a good opportunity to re-assess all the bundled packages licenses...

3. **KiCon Recap** (oursland)
   - Jackson attended KiCon North America 2025 in San Diego and talked to people.
   - Many people use FreeCAD, and one even gave a talk on it (KiConnect).
