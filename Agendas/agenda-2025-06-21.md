# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Saturday, 21 June 2025 1530h UTC**

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes**
   - An FPA admin will begin the recording
   - Will try to make introductions today, both for newcomers and so the AI knows what's going on

2. Discuss establishing ‘Official’ FreeCAD addons (Obelisk)
Identify high-quality FreeCAD addons which are, based on functionality (and possibly other criteria to be later determined) would have their main repos migrated into the FreeCAD organization on Github. 
Original author would be given source-control over the new repo

- Allows FreeCAD organization to assign a new maintainer in the event the addon is abandoned by its author without a need for forking and resulting confusion of which is current
- Gives users better discoverability for high quality addons from an extended list
- Isolates important functionality from the main codebase, which is considered useful but serves a niche audience.
- Can be used to further refine addons before considering inclusion into main.
- Would need a way to give these addons prominence within the manager.
  - Example candidates: Sheet Metal WB, Curves WB, FCInfo Macro, Pie Menu addon
- Give professionals a list of add-ons which can be reasonably trusted for their work.

 If this concept is adopted, propose the inclusion of a “FreeCAD Approved” or similar badging be displayed in addon-manager. It may also provide a secondary incentive for add-ons to strive for higher quality and value to the user.
