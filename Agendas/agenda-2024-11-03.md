# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Sunday, 4 November 2024**

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes** (chennes, cannot attend)
   - An FPA admin needs to log into the FPA gMail account and then to the screenapp.io account to record
    
2. **Transitioning to Qt6-only** (chennes, cannot attend)
   - Ubuntu 20.04 LTS end of support is April 2025
   - Ubuntu 22.04 has Qt6.2 but not PySide
   - Supporting Qt5 takes significant developer effort
   - When and how do we want to make the switch?
