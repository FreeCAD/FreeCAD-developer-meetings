# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Saturday, 18 January 2025**

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes**
   - An FPA admin needs to log into the FPA Gmail account and then to the screenapp.io account to record

2. **FPA Development Fund Grant Process** (chennes)
   - New process for 2025, moving to quarterly instead of rolling
   - Need Grant Committee members, volunteer now!

3. **Rules for closing stale issues** (NewJoker/FEA-eng)
   - new rules may result in many still relevant bug reports and feature requests being closed due to inactivity of their participants
   - [already closed stale issues](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed%20label%3A%22Status%3A%20Auto-closing%22%20)
   - alternative solutions? maybe instead of automatically closing issues the algorithm could send them to maintainers to make the decision
  
4. **Proposal for subforum description changes** (NewJoker/FEA-eng)
   - [suggested changes](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=92660)
   - does everyone agree with them?
   - [recent proof they are needed](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=93899#p804111)
  
5. **The need for rules for new GUI translators** (NewJoker/FEA-eng)
   - it's quite common that a newcomer starts translating strings in Crowdin without caring about the rules or contacting the team of translators working with a certain language
   - maybe there should be some short verification like for new wiki users
