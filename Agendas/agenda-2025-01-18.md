# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Saturday, 18 January 2025**

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes**
   - An FPA admin needs to log into the FPA Gmail account and then to the screenapp.io account to record

2. **FPA Development Fund Grant Process** (chennes)
   - New process for 2025, moving to quarterly instead of rolling
   - Need Grant Committee members, volunteer now!

3. **Rules for closing stale issues** (NewJoker/FEA-eng)
   - new rules may result in many still relevant bug reports and feature requests being closed due to inactivity of their participants
   - [already closed stale issues](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed%20label%3A%22Status%3A%20Auto-closing%22%20)
   - alternative solutions? maybe instead of automatically closing issues the algorithm could send them to maintainers to make the decision
  
4. **Proposal for subforum description changes** (NewJoker/FEA-eng)
   - [suggested changes](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=92660)
   - does everyone agree with them?
   - [recent proof they are needed](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=93899#p804111)
  
5. **The need for rules for new GUI translators** (NewJoker/FEA-eng)
   - it's quite common that a newcomer starts translating strings in Crowdin without caring about the rules or contacting the team of translators working with a certain language
   - maybe there should be some short verification like for new wiki users

6. **New file format** (CWG / pierreporte)
   * Github discussion created a month ago: https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/discussions/18532
   * Interesting points made
   * Werner Mayen hasn’t shown up yet
   * Presentation of the new formalism
   * Closely related: formatting of tree view entries (showing attributes, instance numbers, etc.)

7.  **Cosmetic threads** (CWG / pierreporte)
    * Feature specification: https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/5567#issuecomment-2543142577
    * UI/UX done for standalone feature and hole tool
    * New PR for hole tool, to be altered when cosmetic threads are implemented: https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/19052
    * Work can start right now in collaboration with CWG
    * Because it’s a feature for TechDraw, it could qualify to the new goal of more compliance to standards

8. **FreeCAD evaluation with a redesign** (pierreporte)
	* As promised, made an existing design in FC during holidays
	* Most frustrating issues: https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/11914, https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/18985
