# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Sunday, 7 December 2025 16:30h UTC**

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes**
   - An FPA admin will begin the recording
   - Will try to make introductions today, both for newcomers and so the AI knows what's going on
  
2. **"Adopted" Addon policies** (chennes)
   - The FPA is now sponsoring an Addon Ecosystem Coordinator position
   - One task is to "adopt" unmaintained addons
   - What needs to be retained to ensure good community relations?
     - Repo name?
     - Addon name?
     - Author credit?
   - We don't want to give the impression we are "hijacking" someone else's work
