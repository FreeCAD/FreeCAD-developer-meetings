# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Sunday, 7 December 2025 16:30h UTC**

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes**
   - An FPA admin will begin the recording
   - Will try to make introductions today, both for newcomers and so the AI knows what's going on

2. **"Adopted" Addon policies** (chennes)
   - The FPA is now sponsoring an Addon Ecosystem Coordinator position
   - One task is to "adopt" unmaintained addons
   - What needs to be retained to ensure good community relations?
     - Repo name?
     - Addon name?
     - Author credit?
   - We don't want to give the impression we are "hijacking" someone else's work  

3. **[FEP-0010: Variant Parts](https://github.com/pieterhijma/FreeCAD-Enhancement-Proposals/blob/variant-parts/FEPs/FEP-0010-variant-parts/README.md) accepted** (pieterhijma)
   - No concerns raised in the discussion period
   - One small "nice-to-have" comment -> turns out to work out-of-the-box
   - Will start implementation work now

4. **Would like to see more focus on adding tests** (pieterhijma)
   - Increase robustness of software
   - Examples that would have benefitted from more thorough tests:
	 - (auto) refine, for example [#25821](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/25821)
	 - fuzzy value of booleans, for example [#25146](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/25146)
   - Perhaps a technique as [QuickCheck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck) is worth considering.

5. **OCCT Liaison topic** (pieterhijma)
   - Do we want more effort into reporting bugs?
	 - Report as much as possible to OCCT and wait for upstream to fix
	 - I'm in favor of this
   - Do we want more effort into preventing OCCT issues?
	 - Add workarounds to FreeCAD
	 - Helps to prevent data loss
	 - Can mask issues that should be fixed
