# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Sunday, 7 September 2025 1530h UTC**

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes**
   - An FPA admin will begin the recording
   - Will try to make introductions today, both for newcomers and so the AI knows what's going on

2. **Packaging and distribution formats for Linux** @mnesarco
   - Flatpak and AppImage are well know and battle tested distribution formats for Linux similar to the App Image used in Mac. Windows distribution is a different thing.
   - Currently we maintain compatibility with older versions of libraries just because freeecad can be
installed from distro system repos (rpm, deb, etc..) which have to link with outdated library versions.
   - If we distribute FreeCAD for Linux using only Flatpak and AppImage we can use latest versions of
almost everything.
   - This does not affect the "Build from source" option,
currently the recommended way of "build from source" is pixi which also does not use system versions of libs.
   - OCCT is experimenting a new breath of changes and improvements and probably we want to use them.
   - Qt5 is EOL now.
   - C++20 allows us to do cleaner and safer code and c++23 is coming, we can get all those benefits.

3. **FEP-0008: Project Group Structure** @kadet1090
   - Continuation of discussion from [Sunday, 03 August 2025 developer meeting](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-developer-meetings/blob/main/Minutes/minutes-2025-08-03.md)
