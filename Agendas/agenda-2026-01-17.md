# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Saturday, 17 January 2026 16:30h UTC**

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes**
   - An FPA admin will begin the recording
   - Will try to make introductions today, both for newcomers and so the AI knows what's going on

2. **Reducing number of CI builds** - kadet1090
   - Right now we are building each PR 5 times: Windows, Ubuntu + pixi on each platform
   - Builds are long so this causes a lot of wasted CI hours on build processes + uses a lot of cache
   - Suggestion: Build only on pixi
