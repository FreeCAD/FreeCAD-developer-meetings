# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Saturday, 17 January 2026 16:30h UTC**

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes**
   - An FPA admin will begin the recording
   - Will try to make introductions today, both for newcomers and so the AI knows what's going on

2. **Reducing number of CI builds** - kadet1090
   - Right now we are building each PR 5 times: Windows, Ubuntu + pixi on each platform
   - Builds are long so this causes a lot of wasted CI hours on build processes + uses a lot of cache
   - Suggestion: Build only on pixi

3. **Re-pin dependencies to Ubuntu 24.04LTS** - chennes
   - @wwmayer provided a fix recently that technically requires OCCT 7.6 (released in November 2021)
   - Could be worked around, but such patches are always a maintenance headache
   - Propose a switch to 24.04LTS as our minimum library set (four months earlier than planned)
   - Exception for Python 3.11, which we will continue to support for Blender compatibility
   - Qt 6.4, gcc 14 and clang 18 (which both support most of C++23)

4. **Addon Ecosystem Technical Projects for 2026** -- mnesarco
   - Because there are many areas of work, we need to define what to do, what to avoid, and what to prioritize.
      - Python/C++ bindings modernization (Already discussed but without a decision)
      - Python API official stubs generation (Partial work done but many problems due to tech debt)
      - Adoption of fcapi 2.0 (Separate presentation)
      - AddonManager Gui modernization
      - QML/Javascript based Addons (Bindings, Core support)
      - Addons portal with metrics, search, rankings, etc...

5. **Websites improvements initiative** - marcuspollio
   - Step 1 (unification of Homepage, News blog and Developers Handbook, funded by FPA grant) is soon complete (https://marcuspollio.github.io/FreeCAD-website/).
   - Need for a maintainer assigned to project supervision and review. Coordination and main work still by marcuspollio.
   - Need for a new official repository, so migration can start: code, workflows, issues, projects, rights, test deploy, etc.
   - Next: open to community contribution for proper content (texts, illustrations, translations, style tweaks), testing and feedback.
   - Discussion at FreeCAD Day (and other channels) for future steps: what, how, etc.


6. **Implicit conversions to QString** - kadet1090
   - We have deliberatery disabled implicit conversion to QString
   - It makes code more explicit in terms of types, but it does not make it easier to read and write
   - In theory forces users to use QStringLiteral or tr for strings so forces to think, in reality that causes a lot of improper `fromLatin1` etc calls causing errors
   - It does not work right now anyway: https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/26294
