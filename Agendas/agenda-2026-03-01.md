   - An FPA admin will begin the recording
   - Will try to make introductions today, both for newcomers and so the AI knows what's going on

2. Supplemental materials addon - davesrocketshop
   - Similar to the Woods material addon
   - No requirement for materials in the core repository
   - More timely updates

3. Implemntation of QtTesting UI testing environment - davesrocketshop
   - Developed for testing ParaView UI https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/qttesting
   - Discord discussion https://discord.com/channels/870877411049357352/1470467283749965854

4. Steam Distribution of FreeCAD - oursland
   - It's been discussed in the past and something that "seems like a good idea" and I want to get that moving
   - Blender distributes via Steam and they encourage software involved in Modeling, Design, and Art to be a part of their library
   - Fee is $100, but the verifiable information on the articles of incorporation should be used.  I'll need help with this.  Yorik?
