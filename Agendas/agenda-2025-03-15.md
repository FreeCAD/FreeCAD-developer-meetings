# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Saturday, 15 March 2025**

(**NOTE**: Most of North America is now in Daylight Saving Time/Summer Time, while most of Europe is not. This meeting is scheduled in Central European Time, so for those in North America it is one hour later than normal.)

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes**
   - An FPA admin will begin the recording

2. **Moving the Addon Manager to a submodule**
   - Addon Manager is 100% Python
   - Some internal AM code is needed by external cache-generation tools
   - As an external repo it could potentially update itself
