# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Sunday, 02 November 2025 1530h UTC**

1. **Python bindings**
   - Review (current)
     - Mixture of raw CPython API, PyCXX, python generator and pybind11
	 - Lots of mismatches between pyi files and c++ files.
	 - Inconsistent module structure between compile time and runtime
	 - Duplicated code in many places
	 - Incomplete pyi files (no constructors, no module level functions, missing
	   signatures, missing overloads)
   	 - Error prone due to manual parsing
	 - Manual process (signature declaration and parsing)
	 - Strange modules creation/initialization
	 - Raw pointer and memory management
	 - Possible memory leaks (some already reported reported)
	 - *pyi files are the initial source of truth,
	   but c++ implementation code may not honour the declared things.
	 - Hard to read/maintain
   - Proposal 1:
     - Modernize with nanobind (successor of pybind11) (https://nanobind.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
	 - No Manual process/redeclarations (more or less)
	 - C++ centric. Bindings and stubs generated from c++ normal code
	 - No manual memory management / no raw pointers
	 - Automatic memory leak detection
	 - Fast compile time (faster than pybind11)
	 - Easy to read/maintain
	 - Modern C++17 code
	 - Candidate for a FEP?
   - Proposal 2:
     - Incremental modernization with a custom made helper for
	   static argument parsing and overload resolution:
	   https://github.com/mnesarco/marzpyb
     - Can be used/intermixed with current bindings
	 - Adds static type checking and overload resolution
	 - Supports PyCXX type for memory management and smart pointers.
	 - Support native types and CPython types also.
	 - Still in development but if nanobind is viable, then this
	   will be dropped in favor of nanobind.
   - Proposal 3:
     - Create FreeCAD Python API 2.0
	 - Fully designed to match python best practices, naming and packaging
	 - New bindings library (new cmake target)
	 - Coexist with legacy API (Can be used intermixed to easy transition)
	 - 75% Declarative and autogenerated from C++ Sources
	 - Use Shiboken6 or nanobind+generator
	 - Documented with sphynx/doxygen/mkdocs... (Not the wiki)

2. **Update FEP-0010: Variant Parts** (pieterhijma)
   - Discussion with jbaehr on separating exposed properties from 'true' input properties
   - Three directions:
	 1. Keep it as is, more or less a pragmatic approach
		 - Use exposed properties to be able to refer to parent objects (drawback)
		 - Use coarse-grained dependency graph to compute topological sort (benefit)
		 - Handles unclear status of input or output of properties
		 - Does not model internal dependencies precisely
	 2. Create a strong separation between input and output properties
		 - Fundamentally a true dependency graph on the level of properties
		 - Large code change -> not really viable I think (drawback)
		 - Very clear semantics on what an input and output property is (benefit)
		 - Does model internal dependencies precisely
	 3. Introduce input properties
		 - Middleground where we have standard input/output properties, output properties, and a new input property.
		 - A true input property can be referenced from child objects (without cyclic deps)
		 - Separation between input properties and exposed properties (benefit)
		 - Requires fine-grained dependency graph to compute topological sort (drawback)
		 - Allows us to gradually improve object/property relations in FreeCAD (benefit)
		 - Does not model internal dependencies precisely

3. **Presentation updated API documentation of the App package** (pieterhijma)
   - About to finish the C++ App API documentation project
   - Screenshare of current documentation
   - Introduced various topics
   - Most important classes have detailed information
  
4. **Discussion Round - Handbook Copyright** (PhoneDroid)  
   Discussion related to the handbook [Pull Request](https://github.com/FreeCAD/DevelopersHandbook/pull/146) documenting SPDX & changing copyright headers.
   - If you plan on participating, please read the PR description
   - The discussion will be in a 1 on 1 style, where I will generally only talk to one person / about one topic at a time
   - Participants are expected to wait their turn to prevent concern dumping
