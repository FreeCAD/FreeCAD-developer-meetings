# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Saturday, 19 October 2024**

1. **Volunteer to take minutes**
2. V1.0 release process and blocker bounties. (sliptonic)
   - FPA is voting to approve budget to place a bounty on outstanding blocker issues.
   - Need this meeting to review outstanding blockers. Determine which ones are _real_ blockers to release.
   - Need this meeting to set rules for claiming a bounty
   - 
3. **DISCUSS: File structure** (CAD Working Group / pierreporte)
   - Reusing FCStd is possible with added attribute group
   - File type is a string parameter in Document.xml and FreeCAD would work differently depending on that
   - Generic FCStd is still desirable but should be advertised as playground or sandbox
   - Solve [issue #12708](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/12708)
   - What about BIM? No BIM users in the Discord discussion currently
4. **DISCUSS**: Fix boolean operations PR. (AIRCAP/CorvusCorax) [PR #17119](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/17119/)
   - The PR is quite big as a small fix has been needed in a lot of places (the linter doesnt help either
   - Can anything be done to get this into 1.0? This pr fixes a lot of bugs.
5. **DISCUSS**: Safe Mode (hyarion)
   - info what is safe mode and why is it important.
   - discussion how fast can we get it merged to help bug triage?
