2. [FEP-0010 Variant Parts](https://github.com/pieterhijma/FreeCAD-Enhancement-Proposals/blob/variant-parts/FEPs/FEP-0010-variant-parts/README.md) updated to 1.1 (pieterhijma)
   - Separation of concerns between input properties and exposed property interface
	 - Introduction of input properties
	 - Possible to refer to input properties from child objects
	 - Exposed properties are separate but they also need to be input properties
   - Any feedback?
