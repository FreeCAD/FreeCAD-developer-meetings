# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Saturday, 15 February 2025**

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes**
   - An FPA admin needs to log into the FPA Gmail account and then to the screenapp.io account to record

2. **How to handle permissions on the new ex-Ondsel repos?** (Yorik)
   - How should we go about this? USe the same permissions as the FreeCAD repo? But then it needs to become part of our weekly merge rountine. Amritpal signalled that there are PRs in the queue already, that are not processed. He asked if he could have merge permissions, and it would make sense to give these permissions to ex-Ondsel people who worked on that code already, and who are going to work further on it through the Ondsel grant. I would maybe elect some of them to be elected maintainers on those repos. Sliptonic might advise who those should be.
