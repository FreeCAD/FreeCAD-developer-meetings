# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Saturday, 15 March 2025**

(**NOTE**: Most of North America is now in Daylight Saving Time/Summer Time, while most of Europe is not. This meeting is scheduled in Central European Time, so for those in North America it is one hour later than normal.)

1. **screenapp.io is taking minutes**
   - An FPA admin will begin the recording
   - Will try to make introductions today, both for newcomers and so the AI knows what's going on

2. **How can we safely deprecate parts of API?** (hyarion)
   - We sometimes we want to deprecate public functions in Python, that 3:rd party might use. How do we safely deprecate stuff?
