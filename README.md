# FreeCAD Developer Meetings

Minutes and agendas for regular meetings of the FreeCAD developer community. Regular meetings are
held on the first Sunday and third Saturday of each month. See https://freecad.org/events.php for
the dates and times in your local timezone.

To add an agenda item, developers with direct repo access are welcome to directly add their item
to the appropriate agenda document. For those developers who do not have access, please submit a
Pull Request at least 24 hours prior to the planned meeting. For interested parties who do not
have a GitHub account, please reach out to a FreeCAD developer in the platform of your choice and
ask someone to consider sponsoring your proposed agenda item.
